Session Schedules
=================

Overview and Requirements
-------------------------
Session Schedules is a collection of python modules and scripts for 
build MCS0030 compliant session definition files (SDFs).  Session 
Schedules builds off of the LSL 0.4.x framework for working with LWA
data and also depends on the following python modules:
  * jinja2
  * wxPython

Not installation (e.g., python setup.py install) is required to use the
software.  Simply run the scripts in the SessionSchedules directory.

Python Contents
---------------
sdf.py
  Module for reading in, validating, and writing SDFs

  wxPython GUI for creating SDF from scratch or modifying existing SDF for
  another purpose.  sessionGUI contains a variety of features for working 
  with SDFs including a name resolver, a graphical observation layout, and 
  a data volume estimator.

resolve.py
  Apache/python script to provide a web-based name resolver.

validator.py
  Apache/python script to validate SDFs via the validation interfaces 
  available in sdf.py and with the tpss executable build from MCS JR5.  
  This validator runs tpss up to level 2.

session-definition.py
  Apache/python script to provide a web interface to creating SDFs.  The 
  interface is crude and occasionally suffers from state problems.
