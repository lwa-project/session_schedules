<h6>Introduction</h6>
Swarm GUI provides an easy-to-use interface to creating interferometer definition files (IDFs) for 
observing with the LWA swarm as an interferometer.<br /><br />

Swarm GUI allows an observer to:
<ul>
	<li>Specify the individual scans in a run,</li>
	<li>Specify how the data is to be correlated,</li>
	<li>Request a particular method for retrieving the data, and</li>
	<li>Estimate the total correlated data volume of the scans.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Beam Forming Modes</h6>
Beam forming modes tracking the sky, Sun, and Jupiter are avaliable.  For each, both tunings are 
supported with the caveat that both tunings will use the same filter code and gain settings.  
The default gain value can be changed if it has been specified under the <a href="#mcs">advanced settings menu</a>.

Swarm GUI supports using the NASA-IPAC and SIMBAD databases to resolve target names listed in the 
&quot;Target&quot; column into their corresponding RA and DEC coordinates.  To use this feature, select 
the scan you wish to resolve via the check box on the left-hand side of the scan list 
and go into the Scans->Resolve Selected menu.

<h6>Data and Reductions</h6>
Swarm GUI provides a means for estimating the data volume associated with each scan via the 
Data->Estimated Data Volume menu.  This menu displays the estimated raw and correlated data volumes 
for each scan in the run using the correlator setup, duration, and filter code given.  The total data 
volumes for the run are also reported.<br /><br />

The correlator parameters and the data return method (UCF, user-provided USB hard drives, etc.) 
can be specified using the Scan->Observer/Project Info. menu.

<h6>Validating IDF Files</h6>
Swarm GUI provides several mechanisms to ensure that the IDFs created are valid and can be successfully
executed.  All basic inputs (frequency, filter code, etc.) are validated and scan lines without
valid output are marked in red.  Additional validation of source visibility for DRX scans is done
when saving the scans to a file.<br /><br />

Swarm GUI provides basic validation of the generated IDF files;  more rigorous validation by the 
MCS/Scheduler can be done <a href="https://fornax.phys.unm.edu/lwa/validator/index.html">here</a>.
The validator calls the &quot;tpss&quot; executable and validates the IDF file to level 2.

<h6>Advanced MCS Settings</h6>
The Scans->Advanced Settings menu allows for finer control of the observing process.<br /><br />

This window also contains the scan gain settings.  Options are also available to change the setup of the ARX filters and gains.  These 
options, however, cannot be fined tuned for a particular antenna and set all antennas to the same value.
<br /><br />

<i>Note:</i> Caution should be used when making changes in the Advanced MCS Settings menu as changes 
could have unintended consequences on the scans. For questions regarding these settings please contact 
LWA staff or an experienced LWA observer.

<h6>Preferences File</h6>
Swarm GUI supports the use of a preferences file to help preserve common information between runs.
The file has a simple text file that uses a "key value" pair format to store information.  It is named 
".sessionGUI" and is looked for in the user's home directory.  It supports the following information:<br />
<ul>
	<li>ObserverID - Numeric LWA-assigned observer ID</li>
	<li>ObserverFirstName - Observer first name</li>
	<li>ObserverLastName  - Observer last name</li>
	<li>ProjectID - LWA-assigned project ID code</li>
	<li>ProjectName - Project name</li>
</ul>
<br />
The values in this file can be populated using the "Save Defaults" button in the
window launched from the Scan->Observer/Project Info. menu.

<b>IDF</b>: <u>I</u>nterferometer <u>D</u>efintion <u>F</u>ile; The files created by Swarm GUI that 
are used by the LWA project office to schedule all of the elements of the LWA swarm.<br /><br />

<b>project</b>: A set of scans which collectively support a defined scientific objective.<br /><br />

<b>run</b>: A subset of scans conducted within the scope of a project that is conducted using 
exactly one of the DP/ADP outputs (that is, one of the beams) within a contiguous time duration, t
ypically a few hours in length.<br /><br />

<b>scan</b>: The process of collecting a contiguous block of data from the run-specified DP/ADP 
output, during which the parameters defining the scan do not change. From the perspective of an 
LWA-1 user, scans are &quot;atomic&quot; units for scheduling purposes.<br /><br />
