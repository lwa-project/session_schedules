<h6>Introduction</h6>
Session GUI provides an easy-to-use interface to creating session definition files (SDFs) for observing at 
LWA stations that are compliant with the format described in 
<a href="http://www.ece.vt.edu/swe/lwavt/doc/MCS0030v4_Observing.pdf">MSC0030</a>.<br /><br />

Session GUI allows an observer to:
<ul>
	<li>Specify the individual observations in a session,</li>
	<li>Request a particular method of getting the data back, and</li>
	<li>Estimate the total data volume of the observations.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Transient Buffer Modes</h6>
Sessions for both the wide-band (TBW) and narrow-band (TBN) modes are supported.  The two modes, however,
cannot be mixed within a single session.<br /><br />

For TBW, both 4 and 12-bit data are supported as well as the full range of samples (up to 36 million with 
4-bit data) in the TBW buffer.  TBW observations cannot be scheduled to fill a time range.  Rather, the 
individual captures need to be scheduled separately.  Session GUI keeps track of the combined integration 
and readout times to make it easier to not overlap TBW captures.<br /><br />

For TBN, all tunings within the DP tuning range (10 to 88 MHz) as well as all 7 filters are supported.  
There is no limit on how long a TBN recording can be scheduled for as long as it does not exceed the DRSU 
capacity.  By default, the TBN gain setting is left up to MCS to decide by can be overridden in the 
<a href="#mcs">advanced settings menu</a>.

<h6>Beam Forming Modes</h6>
Beam forming modes tracking the sky, Sun, and Jupiter and supported.  For each beam, both tunings are 
supported with the caveat that both tunings will use the same filter code and gain settings.  Similar to
TBN the gain value can be changed if it has been specified under the <a href="#mcs">advanced settings menu</a>.
<br /><br />

Session GUI supports resolving targets in the &quot;Target&quot; column into RA and dec. values via the 
Observations->Resolve Selected menu.  To use this feature, select the observation you wish to resolve via the 
check box on the left-hand side of the observation list and go into the resolver menu.  The resolver supports
resolving with both the NASA-IPAC

<h6>Data and Reductions</h6>
Session GUI provides a means for estimating the data volume associated with each observation via the 
Data->Estimated Data Volume menu.  This menu displays the estimated data volume using the observing mode, 
duration, and filter code for each observation in the session as well as the total data volume for the session.
<br /><br />

Reductions and data return method (DRSU, user-provided USB hard drives, etc.) are specified using the 
Observation->Observer/Project Info. menu

<h6>Validating SDF Files</h6>
Although Session GUI provides basic validation of the generated SDF files, more rigorous validation
by the MCS/Scheduler can be done <a href="http://fornax.phys.unm.edu/lwa/schedule/validator.py">here</a>.
The validator calls the &quot;tpss&quot; executable and validates to level 2.

<h6>Advanced MCS Settings</h6>
The Observations->Advanced Settings menu allows for fine control of the various MCS MIB report and update 
intervals as well as controlling what is included in the tar file that is created at the end of a session.
This window also contains the observation gain settings (TBN and DRX)

<h6>Limitations</h6>
<ul>
	<li>Stepped observations (OBS_MODE = STEPPED) are not currently supported.</li>
	<li>Some columns are editable that should not be, e.g., &quot;ID&quot;.</li>

<h6>Glossary</h6>
<b>SDF</b>: <u>S</u>ession <u>D</u>efintion <u>F</u>ile; The files created by Session GUI that are used by
the MCS/SessionScheduler to setup and obtain observations.<br /><br />

<b>project</b>: A set of observations which collectively support a defined scientific objective.<br /><br />

<b>session</b>: A subset of observations conducted within the scope of a project that is conducted using 
exactly one of the 5 principal DP outputs (that is, one of the 4 beam outputs or the TBW/TBN output) 
within a contiguous time duration, typically a few hours in length.  Informally, a session might be 
described as an &quot;observing run&quot;.<br /><br />

<b>observation</b>: The process of collecting a contiguous block of data from the session-specified DP 
output, during which the parameters defining the observation do not change. From the perspective of an 
LWA-1 user, observations are &quot;atomic&quot; units for scheduling purposes.<br /><br />
