<h6>Introduction</h6>
Session GUI provides an easy-to-use interface to creating session definition files (SDFs) for observing at 
LWA stations that are compliant with the format described in 
<a href="http://www.ece.vt.edu/swe/lwavt/doc/MCS0030v5_Observing.pdf">MCS0030</a>.<br /><br />

Session GUI allows an observer to:
<ul>
	<li>Specify the individual observations in a session,</li>
	<li>Request a particular method for retrieving the data, and</li>
	<li>Estimate the total data volume of the observations.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Transient Buffer Modes</h6>
Sessions for the wide-band (TBW), frequency domain (TBF), and narrow-band (TBN) modes are supported.  
The three modes, however, cannot be mixed within a single session.  In particular, TBF is only 
available at LWA-SV and other ADP-based stations while TBW is only available at LWA1.<br /><br />

For TBW, both 4 and 12-bit data are supported.  The upper limit for the number of samples for 4-bit data is
36 million, and the corresponding limit for 12-bit data is 12 million.  Due to the nature of TBW, observations 
cannot be scheduled to fill a time range, e.g, capture consecutive sets of a given number of samples.  
Rather, the individual captures need to be scheduled separately.  Session GUI keeps track of the combined integration 
and readout times help avoid overlap in TBW captures.<br /><br />

For TBF, dumps of up to three seconds (588 million samples) are supported.  This limit is set by the memory 
available on the nodes that make up the ADP system.<br /><br />

For TBN, all tunings within the DP tuning range (10 to 88 MHz) as well as all 7 filters are supported. There 
is no limit on the length of a TBN recording as long as the resulting data volume does not exceed the DRSU 
capacity (data volume estimates can be found under the <a href="#data">data menu</a>). By default, the TBN gain setting is 
determined by MCS but can be overridden in the <a href="#mcs">advanced settings menu</a>.

<h6>Beam Forming Modes</h6>
Beam forming modes tracking the sky, Sun, Jupiter, and some stepped observations are avaliable.  For each 
beam, both tunings are supported with the caveat that both tunings will use the same filter code and 
gain settings.  Similar to TBN the default gain value can be changed if it has been specified under the 
<a href="#mcs">advanced settings menu</a>.  It should also be noted that filter code 7 is not currently
supported at LWA-SV and other ADP-based stations.
<br /><br />
The supported stepped observation types are RA/Dec and Az/Alt with the beam forming coefficients calculated 
by MCS.  Specifying the individual antenna gains and delays is currently not supported.
<br /><br />

Session GUI supports using the NASA-IPAC and SIMBAD databases to resolve target names listed in the 
&quot;Target&quot; column into their corresponding RA and DEC coordinates.  To use this feature, select 
the observation you wish to resolve via the check box on the left-hand side of the observation list 
and go into the Observations->Resolve Selected menu.

<a name="data">
<h6>Data and Reductions</h6>
Session GUI provides a means for estimating the data volume associated with each observation via the 
Data->Estimated Data Volume menu.  This menu displays the estimated data volume for each observation in 
the session using the observing mode, duration, and filter code given.  The total data volume for the 
session is also reported.<br /><br />

Post acquisition data reduction and the data return method (DRSU, user-provided USB hard drives, etc.) 
can be specified using the Observation->Observer/Project Info. menu.

<h6>Validating SDF Files</h6>
Session GUI provides several mechanisms to ensure that the SDFs created are valid and can be successfully
executed.  All basic inputs (frequency, filter code, etc.) are validated and observation lines without
valid output are marked in red.  Additional validation of source visibility for DRX observations is done
when saving the observations to a file.<br /><br />

Session GUI provides basic validation of the generated SDF files;  more rigorous validation by the 
MCS/Scheduler can be done <a href="https://fornax.phys.unm.edu/lwa/validator/index.html">here</a>.
The validator calls the &quot;tpss&quot; executable and validates the SDF file to level 2.

<h6>Advanced MCS Settings</h6>
The Observations->Advanced Settings menu allows for finer control of the observing process.  In this 
menu, the various MCS MIB report and update intervals can be tailored and the observer can control any 
desired information (e.g. SSMIF file) to be included in the tar file that is created at the end of the 
session.<br /><br />

This window also contains the observation gain settings (TBN and DRX) and the TBW data bit-mode and sample 
number options.  Options are also available to change the setup of the ARX filters and gains.  These 
options, however, cannot be fined tuned for a particular antenna and set all antennas to the same value.<br /><br />

<i>Note:</i> Caution should be used when making changes in the Advanced MCS Settings menu as changes could 
have unintended consequences on the observations. For questions regarding these settings please contact 
LWA staff or an experienced LWA observer.

<h6>Limitations</h6>
Current limitations in the capabilities of Session GUI are:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Stepped observations with specified antenna delays and gains are not currently supported.</li>
</ul>

<a name="preferences">
<h6>Preferences File</h6>
Session GUI supports the use of a preferences file to help preserve common information between sessions.
The file has a simple text file that uses a "key value" pair format to store information.  It is named 
".sessionGUI" and is looked for in the user's home directory.  It supports the following information:<br />
<ul>
	<li>ObserverID - Numeric LWA-assigned observer ID</li>
	<li>ObserverFirstName - Observer first name</li>
	<li>ObserverLastName  - Observer last name</li>
	<li>ProjectID - LWA-assigned project ID code</li>
	<li>ProjectName - Project name</li>
</ul>
<br />
The values in this file can be populated using the "Save Defaults" button in the
window launched from the Observation->Observer/Project Info. menu.

<h6>Glossary</h6>
<b>SDF</b>: <u>S</u>ession <u>D</u>efintion <u>F</u>ile; The files created by Session GUI that are used by
the MCS/SessionScheduler to setup and obtain observations.<br /><br />

<b>project</b>: A set of observations which collectively support a defined scientific objective.<br /><br />

<b>session</b>: A subset of observations conducted within the scope of a project that is conducted using 
exactly one of the 5 principal DP outputs (that is, one of the 4 beam outputs or the TBW/TBN output) 
within a contiguous time duration, typically a few hours in length.  Informally, a session might be 
described as an &quot;observing run&quot;.<br /><br />

<b>observation</b>: The process of collecting a contiguous block of data from the session-specified DP 
output, during which the parameters defining the observation do not change. From the perspective of an 
LWA-1 user, observations are &quot;atomic&quot; units for scheduling purposes.<br /><br />
