<h6>Introduction</h6>
Session GUI provides an easy-to-use interface to creating session definition files (SDFs) for observing at 
LWA stations that are compliant with the format described in 
<a href="http://www.ece.vt.edu/swe/lwavt/doc/MCS0030v5_Observing.pdf">MCS0030</a>.<br /><br />

Session GUI allows an observer to:
<ul>
	<li>Specify the individual observations in a session,</li>
	<li>Request a particular method for retrieving the data, and</li>
	<li>Estimate the total data volume of the observations.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Transient Buffer Modes</h6>
Sessions for both the wide-band (TBW) and narrow-band (TBN) modes are supported.  The two modes, however,
cannot be mixed within a single session.<br /><br />

For TBW, both 4 and 12-bit data are supported.  The upper limit for the number of samples for 4-bit data is
36 million, and the corresponding limit for 12-bit data is 12 million.  Due to the nature of TBW, observations 
cannot be scheduled to fill a time range, e.g, capture consecutive sets of a given number of samples.  
Rather, the individual captures need to be scheduled separately.  Session GUI keeps track of the combined integration 
and readout times help avoid overlap in TBW captures.<br /><br />

For TBN, all tunings within the DP tuning range (10 to 88 MHz) as well as all 7 filters are supported. There 
is no limit on the length of a TBN recording as long as the resulting data volume does not exceed the DRSU 
capacity (data volume estimates can be found under the <a href="#data">data menu</a>). By default, the TBN gain setting is 
determined by MCS but can be overridden in the <a href="#mcs">advanced settings menu</a>.

<h6>Beam Forming Modes</h6>
Beam forming modes tracking the sky, Sun, and Jupiter are avaliable.  For each beam, both tunings are 
supported with the caveat that both tunings will use the same filter code and gain settings.  Similar 
to TBN the default gain value can be changed if it has been specified under the <a href="#mcs">advanced settings menu</a>.
<br /><br />

Session GUI supports using the NASA-IPAC and SIMBAD databases to resolve target names listed in the 
&quot;Target&quot; column into their corresponding RA and DEC coordinates.  To use this feature, select 
the observation you wish to resolve via the check box on the left-hand side of the observation list 
and go into the Observations->Resolve Selected menu.

<a name="data">
<h6>Data and Reductions</h6>
Session GUI provides a means for estimating the data volume associated with each observation via the 
Data->Estimated Data Volume menu.  This menu displays the estimated data volume for each observation in 
the session using the observing mode, duration, and filter code given.  The total data volume for the 
session is also reported.<br /><br />

Post acquisition data reduction and the data return method (DRSU, user-provided USB hard drives, etc.) 
can be specified using the Observation->Observer/Project Info. menu.

<h6>Validating SDF Files</h6>
Session GUI provides several mechanisms to ensure that the SDFs created are valid and can be successfully
executed.  All basic inputs (frequency, filter code, etc.) are validated and observation lines without
valid output are marked in red.  Additional validation of source visibility for DRX observations is done
when saving the observations to a file.<br /><br />

Session GUI provides basic validation of the generated SDF files;  more rigorous validation by the 
MCS/Scheduler can be done <a href="http://fornax.phys.unm.edu/lwa/schedule/validator.py">here</a>.
The validator calls the &quot;tpss&quot; executable and validates the SDF file to level 2.

<h6>Advanced MCS Settings</h6>
The Observations->Advanced Settings menu allows for finer control of the observing process.  In this 
menu, the various MCS MIB report and update intervals can be tailored and the observer can control any 
desired information (e.g. SSMIF file) to be included in the tar file that is created at the end of the 
session.<br /><br />

This window also contains the observation gain settings (TBN and DRX) and the TBW data bit-mode and sample 
number options.  Options are also available to change the setup of the ARX filters and gains.  These 
options, however, cannot be fined tuned for a particular antenna and set all antennas to the same value.<br /><br />

<i>Note:</i> Caution should be used when making changes in the Advanced MCS Settings menu as changes could 
have unintended consequences on the observations. For questions regarding these settings please contact 
LWA staff or an experienced LWA observer.

<h6>Limitations</h6>
Current limitations in the capabilities of Session GUI are:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Explicit checking for overlapping observations is not preformed.</li>
	<li>Stepped observations (OBS_MODE = STEPPED) are not currently supported.</li>
	<li>The post-acquisition data reduction procedures are not yet defined, therefore reduction options 
	are not specified in Session GUI.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Glossary</h6>
<b>SDF</b>: <u>S</u>ession <u>D</u>efintion <u>F</u>ile; The files created by Session GUI that are used by
the MCS/SessionScheduler to setup and obtain observations.<br /><br />

<b>project</b>: A set of observations which collectively support a defined scientific objective.<br /><br />

<b>session</b>: A subset of observations conducted within the scope of a project that is conducted using 
exactly one of the 5 principal DP outputs (that is, one of the 4 beam outputs or the TBW/TBN output) 
within a contiguous time duration, typically a few hours in length.  Informally, a session might be 
described as an &quot;observing run&quot;.<br /><br />

<b>observation</b>: The process of collecting a contiguous block of data from the session-specified DP 
output, during which the parameters defining the observation do not change. From the perspective of an 
LWA-1 user, observations are &quot;atomic&quot; units for scheduling purposes.<br /><br />
